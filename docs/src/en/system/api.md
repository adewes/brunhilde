# APIs

Zilp-Zalp offers several APIs to manage data in the system:

* The global backend provides a **JSON-RPC** API and is used for communication between users, operators and health authorities.
* Health departments and (optionally) operators use local applications, each providing **REST APIs** to exchange data.

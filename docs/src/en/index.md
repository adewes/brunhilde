# Welcome!

Zilp-Zalp is an [open source](https://github.com/adewes/zilpzalp), free and freely usable contact tracking platform. This page documents the various protocols and applications that make up Zilp-Zalp.

Zilp-Zalp supports several [protocols]({{'protocols.index'|href}}), including [paper-based contact tracing]({{'protocols.paper-based'|href}}) and [digital contact tracing]({{'protocols.digital'|href}}).

## What makes Zilp-Zalp

Zilp-Zalp, unlike almost all other solutions, relies primarily on a contact tracing system that combines digital and analogue processes in an innovative way. This is important from our point of view, as a contact tracing system should be usable by everyone in the company.

Fully digital solutions such as the Corona alert app cannot reach large populations and therefore effectively exclude them from contact tracing. Systems such as Luca and Recover, which are primarily digitally oriented, offer workarounds for analogue contact tracing, but generally do not provide a high level of data protection for them (see e.g. [LucaTrack](https://lucatrack.de/LucaTrack%20Pressebeschreibung.pdf)).

In contrast to these systems for users, Zilp-Zalp primarily relies on an analogue, paper-based form of contact tracking, which also works without technical knowledge, offers a very high level of data protection and is uncomplicated to use.
This form of contact tracking is also more accessible and usable by almost everyone.
Only the one-time initialization process requires a user to use a web application; this process can also be made accessible to almost everyone with the support of third parties. 

For operators of localities (restaurants, pubs, etc.), on the other hand, Zilp-Zalp creates opportunities to carry out visit documentation asynchronously (e.g. daily).
This is enormously important for many operators, as they do not always have the necessary infrastructure to carry out direct documentation or it is not logistically possible (e.g. at large events).
Here, too, Zilp-Zalp tries to innovatively combine analogue processes with technological solutions.

In contrast to "self-check-in" systems, Zilp-Zalp also offers hardly any attack surface for misuse, as has already been [demonstrated for](https://twitter.com/janboehm/status/1379573411400286209) other systems.

Finally, unlike other providers, Zilp-Zalp relies entirely on an open and federated infrastructure.
